*******************************************************************************
This guithub repository only contains MY OWN configuration file (and associated
plugins) for VIm editor. I put it here for 2 reasons: Keep an online backup and
let interrested people read / reuse functionalities I've implemented.
*******************************************************************************

To use VIm with my config and plugins:

1. Install vim (default vi is not sufficient)
2. Install ctags (required for taglist and some of my own features)
3. Change "Tlist_Ctags_Cmd" by the result of "which ctags" shell command
4. Change "workspacedir" to your own projects directory
5. Copy vimrc to ~/.vimrc
6. Copy vim to ~/.vim

Main features:

* When working with a PHP project, press F5 to refresh classes & functions list
* You can use Shit-Tab (edit mode) to use auto-completion
* Use Shift-C (edit/visual mode) to comment/uncomment lines
* Use Tab/Shift-Tab (edit/visual mode) to increment / decrement line indentation
* Use Space to fold / unfold code
* Use Shift-q to return to the last editing place
* Press F8 to toggle file navigator and outline
* Press F2 to toggle signature of the function under the cursor
* Press F3 to open definition of the function under the cursor
* Press Ctrl-F to search something in the whole project (then F6 / F7 to navigate)
* Use Ctrl-T to open a new tab, Ctrl-PageUp / Ctrl-PageDown to navigate
* ...

My own functions can probably be optimized but works fine for me since 2009-2010,
if you have suggestions, do not hesitate to submit pull requests.
