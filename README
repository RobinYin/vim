*******************************************************************************
This guithub repository only contains MY OWN configuration file (and associated
plugins) for VIm editor. I put it here for 2 reasons: Keep an online backup and
let interrested people read / reuse functionalities I've implemented.
*******************************************************************************

To use VIm with my config and plugins:

1. Install vim (default vi is not sufficient)
2. Install ctags (required for taglist and some of my own features)
3. Change "Tlist_Ctags_Cmd" by the result of "which ctags" shell command
4. Change "workspacedir" to your own projects directory
5. Copy vimrc to ~/.vimrc
6. Copy vim to ~/.vim

Main features:

* When working with a PHP project, press F5 to refresh classes & functions list
* When adding / removing functions, constants or classes to a file, no need to refresh:
The project tags will be updated transparently as soon as you will save this file
* You can use Shit-Tab (edit mode) to use auto-completion
* Use Shift-C (edit/visual mode) to comment/uncomment lines
* Use Tab/Shift-Tab (edit/visual mode) to increment / decrement line indentation
* Use Space to fold / unfold code
* Use Shift-q to return to the last editing place
* Press F8 to toggle file navigator and outline
* Press F2 to toggle signature of the function under the cursor
* Press F3 to open definition of the function under the cursor
* Press Ctrl-F to search something in the whole project (then F6 / F7 to navigate)
* Use Ctrl-T to open a new tab, Ctrl-PageUp / Ctrl-PageDown to navigate
* ...

Please note that colors and mapping could not be adapted to your environment:
I'm working on a french keyboard, so some keys are not placed like on qwerty keyboards.
Moreover, I've changed some key code sent to my terminal, to interpret the correct key.
FYI, I'm using bash and xterm-color, with a dark theme.

My own functions can probably be optimized but works fine for me since 2009-2010,
if you have suggestions, do not hesitate to submit pull requests.
